# Windows Executable Disassembly

In this class assignment, I reverse engineered a given Windows PE executable. I produced a summary of my approach to reverse engineering the executable, the purpose, content, and structure of each variable defined in the program used to create the executable, algorithms of user written functions within the program, and a detailed de-obfuscation algorithm and equivalent C programming code, explaining the data de-obfuscation function and the de-obfuscated data produced as output. The disassembly-of-a-windows-executable.md file contains this summary.

IDA Pro and OllyDbg were used in carrying out this reverse engineering exercise.
